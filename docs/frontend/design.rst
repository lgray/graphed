How graphed works
=================

You write the analysis you always write: fields, cuts, sums, a histogram fill. None of it runs as
you write it. Each operation becomes a node in a graph carrying the type of its result and the
line of your file that made it; when you ask for a value, what executes is the *reduced* graph —
duplicate work collapsed, unused branches dropped, the survivors fused into a few passes over the
data.

This page is how that works and how to drive it: why the graph stays small while you build it,
how a systematic variation rides through the whole analysis, what actually gets read off disk,
and how a recorded analysis becomes a plan a cluster can run.


Your code, kept instead of run
------------------------------

.. code-block:: python

    import numpy as np
    from graphed import Session, compile_ir, evaluate_ir
    from graphed.numpy import NumpyBackend, from_array

    s = Session(NumpyBackend())
    pt = from_array(s, "pt", np.arange(6.0))
    sel = (pt * 2.0 + 1.0)[pt > 2.0]        # four operations recorded, nothing computed

    p = s.provenance(sel)
    print(s.form(sel).describe())
    print(f"{p.lineno}: {p.source}")
    print(s.materialize(sel))

    compiled = compile_ir(s, sel)           # reduce the graph for this one output
    print(evaluate_ir(compiled, NumpyBackend(), {"pt": np.arange(6.0)}))

Prints::

    vector[float64]
    7: (pt * 2.0 + 1.0)[pt > 2.0]
    [ 7.  9. 11.]
    [array([ 7.,  9., 11.])]

A :class:`~graphed.Session` owns the graph plus the three side tables that make the rest of this
page possible:

* the **form** of every node — the type and shape of its result, computed from metadata with no
  data touched (awkward calls this a form; ``graphed.numpy`` reports dtype and shape the same
  way);
* the **provenance** of every node — file, line, enclosing function, and the exact
  sub-expression text, captured as you record;
* the **sources** — what each input name will be bound to at run time.

What you hold is a :class:`~graphed.Array`: a proxy carrying a session and a node id, nothing
else. It implements the surface every deferred array shares — arithmetic and comparison
operators, ``__array_ufunc__`` (so ``np.sqrt(x)`` records instead of computing), boolean, slice,
integer and field-list indexing, and the tuple key that indexes *inner* axes — ``x[:, :2]``,
``x[:, 0]``, ``x[:, None, :]``, ``x[..., 0]`` — whose members are slices with integer fields,
integers, ``None`` and at most one ``Ellipsis``. A tuple key must leave the partitioned axis
whole, which is what keeps it partition-local and fusible, unlike the bare ``x[1:3]`` and ``x[3]``
that consume that axis and record boundaries; a key that would consume it, ``x[1:3, 0]``, is
refused at record time and hands you the spelling that does work, ``x[1:3][:, 0]``. A leading
``:`` always leaves that axis whole; a leading ``...`` does so only while it still has an axis to
absorb, so ``x[..., 0]`` is a key on a nested ``x`` and is ill-typed on a flat one — the members
after the ``...`` must address fewer axes than ``x`` has, which the backend checks against the
form and reports at your line. The surface is shared but not universal: a backend declares whether
it evaluates inner-axis keys, and one that does not refuses them. Anything idiomatic to *one*
array library lives in that
library's package: ``graphed.numpy`` hands you a richer proxy with ``.shape``, ``.sum()`` and
``__array_function__``; ``graphed.awkward`` keeps the plain proxy and exposes its idiom as free
functions, exactly as ``ak.*`` does. One library's conventions never leak into the other's.

A scalar operand is not an input but a param, and it records everything it imposes on the result.
A Python ``bool``, ``int`` or ``float`` records as itself; a numpy scalar records its dtype name
beside its exact value, so ``mask * np.uint64(1 << 3)`` is ``uint64`` rather than the ``float64``
a coerced operand would have forced, and ``np.uint64(2**64 - 1)`` arrives whole. The frontend
reads the dtype off the object and still imports neither numpy nor awkward. Dtype and value
together decide the node, which makes ``np.uint64(1)``, ``np.int32(1)`` and ``1`` three nodes.

Two ways to get a value out. ``materialize`` walks the graph in this process and is right for
small, local data and for poking at things interactively. ``compile_ir`` + ``evaluate_ir`` is the
path everything else takes: reduce once, then evaluate the reduced node list wherever the data
is. ``evaluate_ir`` returns one entry per requested output.


Why the graph stays small while you build it
--------------------------------------------

The failure mode this design exists to avoid is the one you have already met: a graph that grows
for an hour, then an optimizer whose own runtime dominates the analysis. So the collapsing happens
on the way in, not at the end.

.. code-block:: python

    import numpy as np
    from graphed import Session, compile_ir
    from graphed.core import GraphStore
    from graphed.numpy import NumpyBackend, from_array

    s = Session(NumpyBackend())
    pt = from_array(s, "pt", np.arange(6.0))

    def tight(a):                 # a helper you call from two places
        return a[a > 2.0]

    first, second = tight(pt), tight(pt)
    print("same node:", first.node_id == second.node_id)

    scaled = pt * 1.0             # a no-op left behind by somebody's helper
    unused = pt * 99.0            # nothing you asked for depends on this
    print("recorded:", s.node_count())

    compiled = compile_ir(s, first, scaled)
    for node in GraphStore.deserialize(bytes(compiled.ir)).nodes():
        print(node["kind"], [m["name"] for m in node.get("members", [])])

Prints::

    same node: True
    recorded: 5
    source []
    stage ['gt', 'getitem']

Read that from the bottom. Five nodes were recorded and two survive: the source, and one fused
run of operations. The cut written twice was one node the second time you wrote it — recording
the same expression on the same inputs returns the node that already exists (*interning*), so
a session can be long-lived and exploratory and still hold the set of distinct computations
rather than the history of your statements. ``pt * 1.0`` collapsed into ``pt`` itself, so
``scaled`` is the source node. ``pt * 99.0`` fed nothing you asked for and is gone. The two
operations that remained were fused into one *stage* — a run of operations executed together as a
single pass over the data — so the interpreter is entered once for the group instead of once per
operation.

That collapsing is not a fixed list of rewrites applied in a fixed order. The optimizer holds the
equivalent forms of your expression together and picks the cheapest (equality saturation over
e-graphs, in a compiled Rust extension). A stage ends where the data has to change shape or leave:
reading a source, a reduction, a repartition, a join, or a call out to something
graphed does not look inside — a correction, an ML model, a histogram fill.

Reduction can also run continuously rather than at compile time. ``Session(backend,
incremental=True)`` maintains the reduced form as you build, so the un-reduced graph never
exists at all; both paths produce byte-identical output for the same analysis, so the choice
costs you nothing in reproducibility.


Where a mistake shows up
------------------------

At the line you wrote it, before any file is opened:

.. code-block:: python

    import awkward as ak
    from graphed import GraphedTypeError, Session
    from graphed.awkward import AwkwardBackend, from_awkward

    s = Session(AwkwardBackend())
    ev = from_awkward(s, "events", ak.Array({"Jet": ak.zip({"pt": [[40.0, 25.0], [55.0]]})}))

    try:
        ht = ev.Jet.et                       # there is no `et` field — only `pt`
    except GraphedTypeError as exc:
        print(exc.detail)
        print(f"line {exc.provenance.lineno}: {exc.provenance.source}")

Prints::

    no field named 'et'
    line 9: ev.Jet.et

Type inference runs on the recorded forms, so a missing field, a non-boolean mask or a shape
mismatch is a :class:`~graphed.GraphedTypeError` raised while you are still recording — not an
exception from worker 47 four hours in. The exception carries the operation, the detail, and the
provenance record shown above.

Failures that can only happen at run time are the job of ``graphed.debug``, which re-raises them
on your machine pointing at your analysis line; see :doc:`../debug/design`. The frontend's
contribution is that the provenance is there for every node, cheaply, from the moment it was
recorded.


Vary once, get every universe
-----------------------------

Each label **names a point** in nuisance space. A label registered without ``points=`` carries the
default point ``{name: tag}`` and so differs from ``nominal`` on exactly one axis — a jet-energy
scale shifted, a scale factor scaled up and down; that axis-aligned set is the default and is what
most analyses need. A universe displaced on two or more axes at once is registered explicitly with
``points=`` (below) and is never produced implicitly. Either way you write the analysis once:
``graphed.vary`` attaches the knob, and everything downstream carries the whole family.

.. code-block:: python

    import numpy as np
    from graphed import Session, compile_ir, labels, nominal, universe, vary
    from graphed.numpy import NumpyBackend, from_array

    s = Session(NumpyBackend())
    pt = from_array(s, "pt", np.array([10.0, 20.0, 30.0]))

    jes = vary(pt, "jes", up=pt * 1.05, down=pt * 0.95)

    print(labels(jes))
    print(s.materialize(nominal(jes)))
    print(s.materialize(universe(jes, "jes_up")))

    try:
        compile_ir(s, jes)
    except Exception as exc:
        print(type(exc).__name__, exc)

Prints::

    ('nominal', 'jes_up', 'jes_down')
    [10. 20. 30.]
    [10.5 21.  31.5]
    GraphedError graphed.compile_ir does not accept a Varied output; pass one universe with graphed.universe(v, label), or build the varied plan through the histogram group API

``vary`` returns a :class:`~graphed.Varied`: a handle that behaves like the value you varied but
carries a labelled family — ``"nominal"`` plus one universe per tag. It never mutates anything, so
``pt`` stays exactly as valid as it was. Three read-only verbs narrow a family, and each also
accepts a plain value and returns it unchanged, so helper code does not need to care whether its
input is varied: ``labels`` lists the family, ``nominal`` is the central universe, and
``universe`` picks one by label. Compiling refuses an ambiguous family on purpose — you compile
the universes you name.

The labels live in the frontend only. Each universe lowers to an ordinary marked output, so the
optimizer, the plan format and the executor never learn the word "variation" — and interning
still shares whatever the universes have in common, which is usually almost everything.

Where this lives: the machinery is the ``graphed.systematics`` package — ``registration`` is
``vary`` itself (the checks, the minting, the fan-out), ``ambient`` is the event weight's operation
list and everything that decides over it, ``explain`` is the report at the end of this section,
``varied`` is the ``Varied`` container, ``accessors`` is the reader verbs above, ``by_label`` reads
columns per label, and ``kinds`` / ``tags`` / ``points`` spell a variation's kind, its universe tags
and a family's points. You never import by that path: ``vary``, ``labels``, ``weight``, ``explain``
and the rest are exported from ``graphed``, and the event context they ride is ``graphed.context``,
which keeps the ambient state that ``ambient`` decides over.

Variations that ride an event context
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Varying one array by hand is fine for one knob. A real analysis varies a whole collection, or a
weight that every histogram must pick up, and does it once at the top. That is what an **event
context** is for: wrap your event record in one, read your collections through it, and the
context remembers which variations are in play and which weight is ambient. ``graphed.awkward``
supplies the NanoEvents-flavoured constructor, ``gnano.events``.

.. code-block:: python

    import awkward as ak
    import graphed.awkward as ga
    from graphed import Session, explain, labels, universe, variations, vary, weight
    from graphed.awkward import AwkwardBackend, from_awkward, gak

    events = ak.Array({
        "MET": ak.zip({"pt": [10.0, 20.0, 30.0]}),
        "Jet": ak.zip({"pt": ak.Array([[40.0, 25.0], [55.0], [30.0, 60.0, 20.0]])}),
    })

    s   = Session(AwkwardBackend())
    ev  = from_awkward(s, "events", events)
    ctx = ga.gnano.events(ev)

    w   = ev.MET.pt
    ctx = vary(ctx, "pu", w, is_weight=True,
               points={"1p0": w * 1.1, "m1p0": w * 0.9, "extreme": w * 1.3})

    jets = ctx.Jet
    ctx  = vary(ctx, "jes", collections={"Jet": {
        "up":   gak.with_field(jets, jets.pt * 1.05, "pt"),
        "down": gak.with_field(jets, jets.pt * 0.95, "pt")}})

    ht  = gak.sum(ctx.Jet.pt, axis=1)   # written once, computed in every jet-scale universe
    sel = ctx[ht > 70.0]                # the cut follows the variations too

    print(labels(ht))
    print(labels(sel.Jet.pt))
    print(labels(weight(ctx)))
    print(variations(ctx)["jes"])
    print(variations(ctx)["pu"])
    print(s.materialize(universe(ht, "jes_up")))

Prints::

    ('nominal', 'jes_up', 'jes_down')
    ('nominal', 'jes_up', 'jes_down')
    ('nominal', 'pu_1p0', 'pu_m1p0', 'pu_extreme')
    {'up': (Kind.SHIFT, None), 'down': (Kind.SHIFT, None)}
    {'1p0': (Kind.WEIGHT, Fraction(1, 1)), 'm1p0': (Kind.WEIGHT, Fraction(-1, 1)), 'extreme': (Kind.WEIGHT, None)}
    [68.2, 57.8, 116]

``ht`` was written once and is varied because it reads a varied collection through the context.
The cut is written once and applies inside every universe. The pile-up weight does not appear in
``ht``'s labels because a weight is not part of the value — it is applied where the fill happens,
automatically, to every universe.

A collection that is a *function* of the varied one — Type-1 MET recomputed from the jets — has
to move with it, and two ``{tag: record}`` maps would spell the same shifts twice. The shift form
therefore also takes a ``Varied`` as a collection member: vary the context's central jets with the
loose form, compute MET from that container, and pass both. Such a member is accepted only when it
carries exactly the family being registered and its nominal is the context's own collection;
anything else — another family's labels, a container built on a rescaled nominal — is refused with
a message naming both spellings, and the hand map stays the spelling for those programs.

.. code-block:: python

    from graphed import nominal
    from graphed.context import EventContext

    def type1_met(met, jets, central):
        return gak.with_field(met, met.pt - gak.sum(jets.pt - central.pt, axis=1), "pt")

    raw  = ev.MET
    ctx  = EventContext(s, ev, collections={"Jet": ev.Jet, "MET": type1_met(raw, ev.Jet, ev.Jet)})
    jets = ctx.Jet
    jets = vary(jets, "jes", up=gak.with_field(jets, jets.pt * 1.05, "pt"),
                             down=gak.with_field(jets, jets.pt * 0.95, "pt"))
    met  = type1_met(raw, jets, nominal(jets))              # Varied over jes by propagation
    ctx  = vary(ctx, "jes", collections={"Jet": jets, "MET": met})

    up = universe(ctx, "jes_up")
    print(labels(met))
    print(s.materialize(up.MET.pt))
    print(s.materialize(type1_met(raw, universe(jets, "jes_up"), ev.Jet).pt))

Prints::

    ('nominal', 'jes_up', 'jes_down')
    [6.75, 17.2, 24.5]
    [6.75, 17.2, 24.5]

The context's MET is the Type-1 MET of its central jets, so the propagated container's nominal is
that very node and the ``jes_up`` universe's MET is the MET of the ``jes_up`` jets.

Two kinds of knob, and the distinction is the one that matters for cost. ``Kind.SHIFT`` changes
the *values* — a shifted jet collection — so every universe needs its own pass over the data.
``Kind.WEIGHT`` changes only the multiplicative factor, so all its universes can share one pass.
``graphed.Kind`` is a flag, so a tag registered both ways — the weight form by name identity on a
family the shift form already carries — reports the union ``Kind.WEIGHT | Kind.SHIFT``, and a
consumer asks ``Kind.SHIFT in kind`` rather than matching a word. ``graphed.variations`` reports a
context's registry as ``{name: {tag: (kind, ordering)}}``; the weight side comes from the
lineage's registration record, so a cut (``ctx[mask]``) reports exactly what its parent does.
Numeric tags parse to an ordering value — the σ handle you want for envelope plots — under both
the exponent form (``5em1`` is ½) and the datacard form (``1p0`` is 1, ``m1p0`` is −1); a
non-numeric tag such as ``"extreme"`` carries ``None`` and is simply unordered.
Tags may be given as numbers rather than spellings — ``{+2.5: pt * 1.1, -2.5: pt * 0.9}``
mints ``jes_25em1`` and ``jes_m25em1`` — an ``int`` exactly, a ``float`` through its shortest
round-tripping decimal, so ``2.5`` and ``"2.5"`` are one tag and ``{2.0: ..., "2": ...}`` is
refused as one value naming two universes.

The weight form's nominal names the factor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A weight registration's third argument is not only a starting value: it says *which* factor of the
ambient weight this family varies. graphed compares it by node against what is already registered
— never by value, so a re-computed expression with equal values is a different factor — and decides
one of three things before anything is minted.

The compositions ``graphed.weight(ctx)`` handed out are compared first. A node that is one of them
makes the family a **relative delta**: its members already are the whole ambient rescaled, so they
replace the running product at their own labels instead of multiplying into it — everywhere except
a universe another family *placed* at a point naming this family's coordinate, where the member
that family declared is the value you asked for and stands. Such an overlay is
anchored right after the factors its handle was read over, so a factor registered afterwards
multiplies its result, and the handle you read decides nothing by itself — adding or dropping a
``weight(ctx)`` read between registrations changes no value. A handle read over a single factor is
an overlay too, and reads as one even though that factor's nominal is also the handle's: it is the
composition you were given, and every value it produces equals the join's.

Otherwise a node that is a registered factor's nominal makes the family **join that factor**: both
families' universes live in one container, so the scale factor is in the product once and ``hf_up``
is ``SF(up_hf)``, not ``SF(up_hf)`` times ``SF``. The joined container's nominal member is the union
of the two centrals' coordinate universes, so a central computed over jes-shifted jets keeps that
dependence whichever family registered first. A node that is neither becomes a **new factor**, and
the ambient multiplies one more thing.

Two families on one factor share one container, so a joint label of the two reads that container
two levels deep: the cross member the fanned-out family minted for that point, not the product of
the two families' one-at-a-time members. Both of those are absolute values of one weight, and
multiplying them is exactly the double count this rule removes. A joint that really carries both
variations is spelled by building the cross members from the other family's varied member, the
ratio idiom the previous section uses.

A cut or a projection to one universe changes the row space, and the child starts from the single
composed weight it inherits. A handle read at the parent still names that composition at the child
and is still a relative delta there: read over the whole composition the child adopted, it lands
right after it; read over part of the parent's factors, it lands right after that part, and
everything registered later multiplies its result. What is refused is a handle whose universes are
no longer the composition it names — one read before a later join widened a factor it composed —
and one read on a branch this context does not descend from; each message names the read to
repeat. A weight central built before the cut names its factor at the child, and still does after
any number of registrations there: joining one entry re-indexes the whole inherited composition,
and each entry keeps the identity it had in every row space it came through.

Inside ``graphed.universe(ctx, L)`` the join keeps the universe you projected into, because
expanding the inherited composition re-indexes each operation to what the ambient at ``L`` reads of
it: a factor to its member there, read through its own universes, so a weight computed on
jes-shifted jets keeps that dependence when ``L`` is the shift's label; a relative-delta family to
its member there when ``L`` is one of its own universes, which then stands as the whole value; and
one that contributes nothing at ``L`` not at all. Two registrations are refused there rather than
silently answered. Naming the factor ``L`` is a universe *of* is refused, because its member there
is that universe rather than the central and joining would put the central back. And inside a
relative-delta family's own universe, an operation that would land among the factors that family
was read over is refused — a join of one of them, or a handle read over part of them — because that
family's member is your node over the old product and nothing re-derives it over a new one. Each
message names the spellings that work: register the family, or read the handle, at the parent
before projecting; or read a fresh ``graphed.weight()`` handle at the projection, whose record is
the projected composition's.

``graphed.explain(ctx)`` is the view of all this. It answers, in one line per item: which families
you registered, in order, where each was registered and how it entered the ambient — a new factor,
a join naming the factor's other families, an overlay over the families its handle was read over,
a shift over its collections, and any universe it placed at a point; what the ambient is made of
here, one line per operation with the families it carries and the links it was carried through;
and every universe this context carries with where it came from — one at a time, a fan-out joint
over the dependency it read, a placement, or a relative-delta family's own universe — plus, per
family, the families it *composes* with, which is why no joint universe of those two exists, and
the families it *shares* an operation with, whose joint is absent for the opposite reason: they are
two values of one weight, not a product. All of
it is read from what the registrations and the operations' riders already say; nothing is decided
again, and the ambient is read exactly as ``graphed.weight`` reads it. The per-operation view alone
is ``graphed.systematics.ambient_entries(ctx)``.

Two orderings are refused rather than quietly composed, and each message names the order that
works. A relative-delta family registered on a handle read *before* a later join widened one of the
factors that handle composed is refused — its universes are no longer the composition's, so read
the handle again after the join. A join that would widen a factor an overlay was already read over
is refused from the other side, for the same reason: register the absolute family first and the
relative-delta family on a handle read after it.

      nominal: a point over no registered family

``pu`` and ``hf`` are new factors; ``mu`` is the relative delta, so ``mu_up`` is 1.05 times the
nominal rather than 1.05 times a squared product; ``lf`` names ``hf``'s central, so the scale
factor stays in the product once and the oracle line is that product built by hand. In the second
context the joining central is the same scale factor read on the jes-shifted jets, so the union
puts that universe on the shared nominal member and ``jes_up`` reads the weight at its own jets.
The two ``explain`` blocks are the same four registrations read from a cut and from inside
``hf_up``: the joined family names the factor it joined and shares it with ``hf`` rather than
composing with it, the overlay names the two families its handle was read over, and every operation
says which link carried it here. The operations are what the ambient *here* is made of: after the cut
the three factors the child adopted are the ONE product its composed member is, with the overlay
behind it keeping its own line, and inside ``hf_up`` the overlay is gone — that universe carries none
of its coordinate, so the weight there is ``pu * SF(up_hf)`` with no 1.05 in it — while "universes
here" is the single ``nominal``, because that context IS one universe of the ambient rather than a
container of them.

The tour builds every declaration shape in this section — and the ``explain`` block each one
prints — one step at a time: :doc:`../notebooks/systematics-tour`.

Three ways two things can be correlated
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"These two systematics are correlated" means three different things, and graphed keeps them apart
because they cost different amounts and only one of them is new:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 38 46 16

   * - What you mean
     - How you say it
     - New?
   * - Two registrations are the *same fit parameter*
     - **Share the nuisance name.** Two ``vary`` calls with one ``name``.
     - no
   * - A correction *depends on* a quantity a nuisance moves
     - **Propagation.** Compute the correction from the varied quantity, with
       ``gak.apply_correction`` or ordinary ops.
     - no
   * - One universe is displaced on *two or more axes at once*
     - **``points=``.** Register the universe with its coordinate map.
     - yes

Propagation is a recording detail worth spelling out: record a correction with
``graphed.awkward.gak.apply_correction``, not with ``Session.record_external`` directly.
``apply_correction`` goes through the ``gak`` dispatch layer, so a ``Varied`` input fans out and the
correction is *re-evaluated* in each universe — a scale factor whose jet crosses a binning edge
under the shift gets the other bin's value. ``Session.record_external`` is the lower-level call
underneath; it takes plain ``Array`` inputs and knows nothing about labels.

.. code-block:: python

    import awkward as ak
    import correctionlib.schemav2 as cs
    import graphed.awkward as ga
    from graphed import Session, labels, universe, vary
    from graphed.awkward import AwkwardBackend, from_awkward, gak

    payload = cs.CorrectionSet(schema_version=2, corrections=[cs.Correction(
        name="jet_sf", version=1, inputs=[cs.Variable(name="pt", type="real")],
        output=cs.Variable(name="sf", type="real"),
        data=cs.Binning(nodetype="binning", input="pt", edges=[0.0, 40.0, 1000.0],
                        content=[0.95, 1.05], flow="clamp"))],
    ).model_dump_json(exclude_unset=True).encode()

    s   = Session(AwkwardBackend())
    ev  = from_awkward(s, "events", ak.Array({"Jet": [[{"pt": 38.0}], [{"pt": 70.0}]]}))
    ctx = ga.gnano.events(ev)

    jets = ctx.Jet
    ctx  = vary(ctx, "jes", collections={"Jet": {
        "up": gak.with_field(jets, jets.pt * 1.10, "pt")}})

    # with `args=`, `payload` IS the evaluation: the correction is rebuilt from those bytes through
    # graphed's correctionlib plugin on every backend, so the `evaluator` positional goes unread --
    # if it did not, this example would raise instead of printing
    def never_called(*_: object) -> object:
        raise AssertionError("the template path does not consult the caller's callable")

    sf = gak.apply_correction(payload, "jet_sf", [gak.flatten(ctx.Jet.pt)],
                              never_called, args=["$0"])
    print(labels(sf))
    print(s.materialize(universe(sf, "nominal")).to_list())
    print(s.materialize(universe(sf, "jes_up")).to_list())

This example needs ``pip install "graphed[preserve]"`` for ``correctionlib``. Prints::

    ('nominal', 'jes_up')
    [0.95, 1.05]
    [1.05, 1.05]

The 38 GeV jet crosses the 40 GeV edge under the shift, so its scale factor changes from 0.95 to
1.05 — you never wrote a second correction call. :doc:`../awkward/design` covers the recording
itself, content hashing and the reason ``evaluator`` is unread on this path.

A universe at two coordinates at once
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The b-tag scale factor above is itself computed from jets, so it already varies with the jet scale.
What you cannot get from name-sharing or propagation alone is a *universe* that sits at
``jes = up`` **and** ``btag = hf_up`` together. Sharing a nuisance *name* is what correlates two
templates in the fit (one nuisance parameter moves both); this joint universe is a different thing.
It measures the *factorization error* — how far the true two-coordinate response departs from the
sum of the one-coordinate shifts the fit actually interpolates, which has no slot for a joint
template. A member computed from a jet-scale-varied quantity *depends* on ``jes``, and ``vary`` mints its
joint universes for you — one per combination of its own tag and the nuisance's tags. A placement
entry in ``points=`` names the coordinates of the joint universes you want to keep, and resolution
projects each point onto whatever axes each container downstream happens to know.

Prints::

    [1.0328, 1.0275, 1.0559]
    [1.0344, 1.0289, 1.0587]
    [1.0311, 1.0261, 1.0531]

Three things to read off that. The joint universes are **minted, not declared** — ``sf_up`` is
passed once, and ``btag_hf_up__jes_up`` reads it on the shifted jets because the point, not the
object, decides which inner universe a label reads. Without a placement entry the registration
keeps every joint (``btag_hf_down__jes_up`` and its siblings too); the two placements here keep
``hf_up``'s pair and prune ``hf_down``'s. ``btag_hf_up`` names no ``jes`` coordinate, so it keeps
nominal kinematics, exactly as it does today. ``btag_hf_up__jes_up`` names one, so it reads the
shifted jets, and the three numbers differ — which is the whole point, and is what silently taking
the nominal would hide.

What decides whether a coordinate fans out is the member's **dataflow**, not the nuisance's kind.
A coordinate the member reaches through the *ambient weight* — a factor computed from
``weight(ctx)``, or from a registered factor's member at that label where that member is not the
factor's nominal — is already composed label-aligned into the union, so it is not fanned out (it
would multiply that factor in twice). A coordinate the member reaches through *shifted objects* is
a dependency and mints its joints, even when the same nuisance is also registered as a weight, and
even when the member also multiplies a factor that does not vary at that label (the event weight
the context was seeded with, an unrelated family's central member). That case is the CMS b-tag prescription: the
SF's jes-correlated table replaces the central table inside the ``jes`` universe (name identity),
so ``jes`` is a shift and a weight at once, and a further b-tag source evaluated on the jes-shifted
jets still fans out over ``jes``, whichever of the two registrations comes first.

    [1.0521, 1.0437, 1.0896]
    [1.0521, 1.0437, 1.0896]

The joint's weight is the two-level product — the ``jes`` factor's ``jes_up`` member times ``hf``'s
cross member, both on the ``jes_up`` jets — which the last line rebuilds by hand.

A joint label is spelled ``<family>_<tag>__<nuisance>_<coordinate>``; ``graphed.points(obj)`` is
the authoritative coordinate view — label-sorted, each map nuisance-sorted, ``"nominal"`` mapping
to ``{}`` — and it answers only on record-time shapes (a ``Varied``, an event context), because
points are not carried on disk. ``graphed.variations`` keeps reporting a point family as a family.

Numbers reach numeric tags, and zero is asymmetric
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A coordinate is an ordinary tag, and tags come in two flavours that do not mix. An identifier tag
(``up``, ``hf_up``) is opaque and is *not* promoted to ±1σ — that reading is a stats-export
convention, not a frontend fact. A numeric tag is canonicalised by value, so ``"0p5"``, ``"0.5"``,
``0.5`` and ``Fraction(1, 2)`` are one coordinate — as is a numpy scalar of that value, read
through ``numbers`` rather than through ``int``/``float``, so ``np.float64(0.5)``, ``np.float32``
and ``np.int64`` spell the tags their Python values do. Writing a point with numbers therefore
reaches only families registered with numeric tags, and the mismatch is refused rather than
silently resolved to nominal:

.. code-block:: python

    import numpy as np
    from graphed import Session, labels, points, vary
    from graphed.numpy import NumpyBackend, from_array

    s  = Session(NumpyBackend())
    pt = from_array(s, "pt", np.array([10.0, 20.0, 30.0]))

    named  = vary(pt, "jes", up=pt * 1.05, down=pt * 0.95)

        vary(sigmas, "corr", points=[("c", pt), {"corr": "c", "jes": 0}])
    except Exception as exc:
        print(type(exc).__name__, exc)

Prints::

    {'jes_0p5': {'jes': '5em1'}, 'jes_1': {'jes': '1'}, 'nominal': {}}
    PointError unreachable: a placement on graphed.vary('corr'): '1' is not a registered tag of nuisance 'jes', whose tags are ['down', 'up']
    ('nominal', 'shift_0') {'shift': '0'}
    PointError empty: points= entry {'corr': 'c', 'jes': 0} has only the 'corr' coordinate; a foreign coordinate at 0 names the central universe, which is what nominal already is

Every nuisance and coordinate a ``points=`` entry names must already be registered somewhere the
call can see; otherwise a joint point written before its ``jes`` axis exists would quietly produce a
b-tag-only universe wearing a joint name. Labels *inherited* from upstream keep the ordinary silent
fallback to nominal — partial coverage is a legitimate pattern; a coordinate you typed is not.

Note the asymmetry in the last two cases, which is deliberate. In an explicit ``points=`` map a
coordinate of 0 means "this axis sits at its central value", which is what leaving it out already
says, so ``{jes: 1, btag: 0}`` and ``{jes: 1}`` are one point, and an entry left with no foreign
coordinate is refused — that is the plain tag's own universe, not a joint one. A *default* point is never
zero-dropped: its coordinate is the tag you registered, a name for a universe rather than a
displacement, so the legal tag ``0`` mints the ordinary label ``shift_0`` sitting at ``{shift: 0}``,
distinct from ``nominal``, exactly as it does today. To name a universe that sits at zero on some
axis, register it as a tag; ``points=`` cannot spell it.

Also worth knowing: ``points=`` earns a new label only for a genuinely multi-coordinate universe. A
single-coordinate entry is refused, because the plain tag already names that universe and two labels
for one point would mean two slots, two category bins and two templates for a fit to reconcile.
There is no ``explode=`` verb either — a factorial grid falls out of a dict comprehension over
``points=``, and the full grid is a closure study of that factorization error, not fit input.

One histogram per variation, or one variation axis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You have jet-energy up/down and a scale factor up/down. Do you want five histograms, or one
histogram with a ``variation`` axis? By default each universe is its own output — its own
histogram, its own written column. Passing ``variation_axis=True`` to a fill gives you the second
shape instead: one histogram carrying its universes on a ``StrCategory("variation")`` axis, with
the weight-only universes collapsing into a loop inside the fill rather than into separate fills.
That machinery lives in ``graphed-histogram``; from here the two are interchangeable, because
``labels``, ``nominal`` and ``universe`` read a result histogram's variation axis exactly as they
read a family of separate outputs.

Every universe out of one preservation bundle
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A preservation bundle built over a varied value or weight reproduces *every* universe from the
one directory. Hand ``build_bundle`` a ``Varied`` and ``reproduce`` gives you ``{label: counts}``
instead of a single array, each universe identical to what you got at build time; ``inspect``
lists the labels without executing anything.

    True

The manifest carries a per-label output map and declares format version ``2``; an unvaried bundle
keeps its single-output shape and version ``1``, so older bundles stay readable. See
:doc:`../preserve/design` for what else goes in the directory.

Writing every universe to one skim file is the same idea on the I/O side —
``graphed.awkward.to_parquet(..., select=...)`` writes the superset of rows any universe keeps,
plus enough to reconstruct each one; :doc:`../awkward/design` covers it.

What a variation edit does to cached results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Within one run, resuming from a checkpoint works per partition exactly as for an unvaried
analysis: the N-universe result for a partition is one journal entry. Between runs, three edits
behave differently, and you can predict all three from one rule — a cached result is keyed by the
recorded graph plus the worker function, so anything that changes either invalidates it:

* **Adding or removing a variation invalidates everything.** Universes are nodes, so toggling one
  changes the graph and therefore every cached entry. Flipping an expensive shift class on or off
  between runs is a full recompute.
* **Renaming a label usually costs nothing.** With one output per universe the labels are not part
  of the recorded graph, so a rename leaves it byte-identical and the cache survives. The
  exception is the variation-axis shape above: there the labels *are* axis categories inside the
  recorded fill, so renaming one invalidates the cache just as adding a variation would.
* **How you name your worker function decides the rest.** Refer to it by import path —
  ``OpSpec.from_ref("myanalysis:hist_chunk")`` — and its identity is that path, so editing
  unrelated code nearby cannot disturb the cache. Carry it by value instead (a lambda, a closure,
  anything defined in ``__main__``) and its identity is its pickled bytes, so editing the body —
  or anything it closes over, label strings included — invalidates its cached results. The
  import-path form is the documented idiom for this reason; see :doc:`../checkpoint/design`.


What actually gets read off disk
--------------------------------

Before reading anything, a runner wants the minimal input. The frontend walks the graph; the
backend supplies the semantics — the same generic walk that ``materialize`` uses, but with
reporting tracers flowing through instead of values. There are two granularities and the
difference is worth money:

.. code-block:: python

    import awkward as ak
    from graphed import Session
    from graphed.awkward import AwkwardBackend, from_awkward, gak
    from graphed.awkward.projection import project, project_buffers

    events = ak.Array({
        "Jet": ak.zip({"pt": [[40.0, 25.0], [55.0]], "eta": [[0.1, 2.0], [1.0]]}),
        "MET": ak.zip({"pt": [10.0, 20.0]}),
    })

    s  = Session(AwkwardBackend())
    ev = from_awkward(s, "events", events)

    njet = gak.num(ev.Jet, axis=1)          # how many jets, never their values

    print(sorted(project(njet).read_columns["events"]))
    print(sorted(project_buffers(njet).offsets_only_for("events")))
    print(sorted(project_buffers(gak.sum(ev.Jet.pt, axis=1)).columns_for("events")))

Prints::

    []
    ['Jet']
    ['Jet.pt']

:class:`~graphed.Projection` is the column view: which named columns of each source are touched.
It is the right answer for "what should I read to get this value", and for a jet-count analysis
it says *no columns* — true, and useless to a reader, which would either read nothing or give up
and read everything. :class:`~graphed.BufferProjection` is finer: per column, whether its leaf
*data* is needed or only its list structure. Counting jets needs the ``Jet`` offsets and none of
the payload, and a writer can serve that from a counter branch or an index column. Ask for
columns and you get the coarse view back (``to_projection``); ask for buffers and you get the
cheapest correct read.

One more distinction, which is API rather than prose. ``read_columns`` reports what a compiled
graph *syntactically* mentions — including the untouched legs of a ``zip`` — because evaluating a
reduced graph replays every recorded node, and a field the replay mentions has to exist in the
chunk. Buffer projection answers "what data is needed"; ``read_columns`` answers "what must be
present". Plans pass the latter to the reader and let buffer projection narrow the leaves.

Some things cannot be projected through: a callable graphed cannot look inside is opaque by
definition, so no replay can say which columns it reads. Every
projection entry point takes an explicit policy, so this is your choice and never a silent one:
``on_fail="pass"`` assumes the callable adds nothing, ``"warn"`` falls back to reading everything
and tells you, ``"raise"`` refuses.


Compile once, evaluate anywhere
-------------------------------

``compile_ir(session, *outputs)`` reduces the graph *for exactly those outputs* and returns a
:class:`~graphed.CompiledGraph` — the serialized reduced bytes plus the source names it needs.
Outputs are a property of the request, not of the session: compiling ``a`` and then ``b`` from one
session gives two independent single-output artifacts, each byte-identical to what a fresh session
would have produced, while ``compile_ir(s, a, b)`` carries both and evaluates them in one pass.

``evaluate_ir(compiled, backend, sources, externals=...)`` walks the reduced node list once — one
backend dispatch per reduced node, fused members inline. ``sources`` binds source names to data or
to zero-argument loaders. ``externals`` resolves each call-out payload by its content hash and
fails loudly when one is missing, so a correction or a model is never silently skipped.

The bytes in ``compiled.ir`` are the durable artifact, and ``Session.serialized_ir(*outputs)``
hands them to you directly (``optimize=False`` gives the unfused, one-node-per-operation form,
which is what you want when you are auditing what an analysis does). The same analysis always
serializes to the same bytes. Checkpoint keys, preservation bundles and cross-run comparison all
rest on that.


One pass over the dataset, many outputs
---------------------------------------

Most analyses want several results out of one read. ``aggregate_plan`` compiles the outputs you
name into one graph, then builds a plan that reads each partition once, evaluates all of them, and
folds partial results with the reduce/combine functions you supply. The example writes two small
parquet files first so that it runs anywhere:

.. code-block:: python

    import tempfile

    import awkward as ak
    import numpy as np
    from graphed import Session, aggregate_plan, read_columns
    from graphed.awkward import AwkwardBackend, from_parquet, gak
    from graphed.core.execution import SequentialRunner

    # Two small parquet files standing in for a dataset.
    root = tempfile.mkdtemp()
    for i in range(2):
        ak.to_parquet(
            ak.Array({
                "Jet_pt": ak.Array([[40.0, 25.0], [55.0], [30.0, 60.0, 20.0]]),
                "MET_pt": np.array([10.0, 20.0, 30.0]) + 100.0 * i,
                "run": np.array([1, 1, 2]),
            }),
            f"{root}/part{i}.parquet",
        )

    s = Session(AwkwardBackend())
    ev = from_parquet(s, "events", root, steps_per_file=1)

    ht = gak.sum(ev.Jet_pt, axis=1)          # shared by both outputs
    n_high = gak.sum(ht > 60.0, axis=None)
    total_ht = gak.sum(ht, axis=None)

    plan = aggregate_plan(
        n_high,
        total_ht,
        reduce=lambda outs: [float(o) for o in outs],
        combine=lambda a, b: [x + y for x, y in zip(a, b, strict=True)],
        empty=lambda: [0.0, 0.0],
    )
    print(SequentialRunner().run(plan).value)
    print(sorted(read_columns([n_high, total_ht], s.source_ids()[0])))

Prints::

    [4.0, 460.0]
    ['Jet_pt']

Both outputs share the ``ht`` sub-expression, so it is read and evaluated once per partition, not
once per output — and of the three columns in each file, only ``Jet_pt`` is read at all.
``SequentialRunner`` runs the plan here with no extra dependencies; the same plan object is what
you hand to a process pool, a dask cluster or a parsl pool from ``graphed-executors`` (``pip
install graphed-executors``). ``backend=`` names the workers' evaluation backend, ``partitions=``
overrides the partitioning, and ``steps_per_file=`` splits each file into more tasks.
``store=`` (a directory or an fsspec URL) keeps each task's input and partial in a checkpoint
store, so a task can be replayed later with :func:`graphed.debug.replay`.
``graphed-histogram``'s ``gh.plan(...)`` is the same entry point specialised to histograms.

A skim is one more output of the same pass. ``writes=`` takes :class:`graphed.write.PartWrite`
objects, which ``graphed.awkward.parquet_write`` makes for parquet. Each task then writes one part
from the values it already evaluated. ``reduce`` receives the outputs' values as before, followed by
one part path per write:

.. code-block:: python

    import os
    import tempfile

    import awkward as ak
    import numpy as np
    import pyarrow.parquet as pq
    from graphed import Session, aggregate_plan
    from graphed.awkward import AwkwardBackend, from_parquet, gak, parquet_write
    from graphed.core.execution import SequentialRunner

    root = tempfile.mkdtemp()
    ak.to_parquet(
        ak.Array({"pt": [40.0, 25.0, 55.0, 30.0], "w": np.array([1.0, 0.5, 2.0, 1.5], dtype=np.float32)}),
        f"{root}/events.parquet",
    )

    s = Session(AwkwardBackend())
    ev = from_parquet(s, "events", f"{root}/events.parquet", steps_per_file=2)
    selected = ev[ev.pt > 28.0]


    def part_name(partition):
        stem = os.path.basename(partition.uri).removesuffix(".parquet")
        return f"{stem}_{partition.blind_step}.parquet"


    skim = parquet_write(selected, f"{root}/skim", name=part_name, metadata={"sum_w": gak.sum(ev.w)})
    plan = aggregate_plan(
        gak.sum(ev.w),
        reduce=lambda values: (float(values[0]), values[1:]),
        combine=lambda a, b: (a[0] + b[0], a[1] + b[1]),
        empty=lambda: (0.0, []),
        steps_per_file=2,
        writes=[skim],
    )
    total, parts = SequentialRunner().run(plan).value
    print(total, [os.path.basename(p) for p in parts])
    for p in parts:
        print(ak.from_parquet(p).pt.tolist(), pq.read_schema(p).metadata)

Prints::

    5.0 ['events_0.parquet', 'events_1.parquet']
    [40.0] {b'sum_w': b'1.5'}
    [55.0, 30.0] {b'sum_w': b'3.5'}

``name`` turns the task's partition into the part's file name. It sees the partition as the plan
holds it, so a blind partition has no entry range yet (``entry_start == entry_stop == 0``); name it
by ``blind_step``, or pass explicit ``partitions=``. Two tasks whose names collide are refused when
the plan is built, across ``collate``'s plans too. A reduction in ``metadata`` is the reduction over
this part's chunk, which is what a per-part normalization needs; a value that is not an array is
converted with ``str()`` once, at build. ``parquet_write`` forwards ``arrow_options`` to
``ak.to_arrow_table`` and ``parquet_options`` to ``pyarrow.parquet.write_table``, and the metadata
replaces the schema's key-value metadata, so a part can match another tool's files exactly; column
order is the record's, so sort a record in the graph (``rec[sorted(rec.fields)]``) to write sorted
columns. A write's array must be row-aligned: a reduction there is refused, since a part would hold
a per-chunk partial. A plan with writes does not take ``store=``, since a capturing task evaluates
and reduces but does not write, and ``graphed.debug.replay`` refuses it.


Several graphs in one plan
--------------------------

Each source makes its own session, and analysis code often branches in Python on what a dataset
is: MC is weighted and data is not, so their graphs differ. ``graphed.collate`` takes a mapping of
name to plan and returns one plan whose value is ``{name: that plan's value}``:

.. code-block:: python

    import tempfile

    import awkward as ak
    import numpy as np
    from graphed import Session, aggregate_plan, collate
    from graphed.awkward import AwkwardBackend, from_parquet, gak
    from graphed.core.execution import SequentialRunner

    root = tempfile.mkdtemp()
    ak.to_parquet(ak.Array({"pt": [40.0, 25.0, 55.0], "w": np.array([1.0, 0.5, 2.0])}), f"{root}/mc.parquet")
    ak.to_parquet(ak.Array({"pt": [30.0, 60.0, 20.0, 45.0]}), f"{root}/data.parquet")


    def dataset_plan(path, is_mc):
        ev = from_parquet(Session(AwkwardBackend()), "events", path)
        passed = ev.pt > 28.0
        # decided in Python while recording: only the MC graph has a weight
        count = gak.sum(ev.w * passed) if is_mc else gak.sum(passed)
        return aggregate_plan(
            count, reduce=lambda values: float(values[0]), combine=lambda a, b: a + b, empty=lambda: 0.0
        )


    plan = collate({"mc": dataset_plan(f"{root}/mc.parquet", True), "data": dataset_plan(f"{root}/data.parquet", False)})
    print(SequentialRunner().run(plan).value)

Prints::

    {'mc': 3.0, 'data': 3.0}

The collated plan's tasks are each plan's tasks, one after another in mapping order, so a runner
tree-reduces them as usual. A task runs the graph of the plan that holds its ``(file, tree)``,
looked up in a table with one row per file that ships once per worker; a file in two plans is
refused, since one session over that file already shares the read. Writes ride along unchanged. A
name appears in the value only when its plan has at least one task. Running each plan on its own
and collecting ``{name: value}`` gives the same result when each plan's ``combine`` is exact (the
fold order across tasks can differ), so datasets can also be launched separately and joined
afterwards.


An analysis that calls a server
-------------------------------

Some steps are answered by a server rather than read from a file — a Triton inference server
scoring your jets, say. The server's address differs between your laptop, the LPC and lxplus, but
the analysis does not, so the address is not part of it. The analysis declares *what* it needs, by
name; each run supplies *where* that name answers. The example starts a small local HTTP server
that hands out a scale factor, and calls it through an external operation of its own:

.. code-block:: python

    import json
    import tempfile
    import threading
    import urllib.request
    from functools import partial
    from http.server import SimpleHTTPRequestHandler, ThreadingHTTPServer

    import awkward as ak
    from graphed import Session, aggregate_plan
    from graphed.awkward import AwkwardBackend, from_parquet, gak
    from graphed.core.execution import SequentialRunner
    from graphed.preserve.externals import ExternalPlugin, record_external, sha256_bytes
    from graphed.services import ServiceSpec, UnboundService, bind_services

    root = tempfile.mkdtemp()
    ak.to_parquet(ak.Array({"pt": [40.0, 25.0, 55.0]}), f"{root}/events.parquet")


    def fetch_sf(payload, params):
        """Runs once per worker process; params["url"] is the endpoint this run bound."""
        with urllib.request.urlopen(f"{params['url']}/sf.json") as reply:
            return json.load(reply)["sf"]


    SF = ExternalPlugin(kind="sf_server", content_hash=sha256_bytes, load=fetch_sf,
                        evaluate=lambda sf, params, inputs: inputs[0] * sf, samples=lambda: [b"v1", b"v2"])

    s = Session(AwkwardBackend())
    s.declare_service(ServiceSpec("sf", "http", check="http:/sf.json"))
    ev = from_parquet(s, "events", f"{root}/events.parquet")
    corrected = record_external(s, SF, b"v1", [ev.pt], params={"service": "sf"})
    plan = aggregate_plan(gak.sum(corrected), reduce=lambda v: float(v[0]),
                          combine=lambda a, b: a + b, empty=lambda: 0.0)
    print([spec.name for spec in plan.services])

    try:
        SequentialRunner().run(plan)
    except UnboundService as err:
        print(err)

    # a stand-in for the server: it answers GET /sf.json
    with open(f"{root}/sf.json", "w") as f:
        json.dump({"sf": 1.25}, f)


    class QuietHandler(SimpleHTTPRequestHandler):
        def log_message(self, *args):
            pass


    server = ThreadingHTTPServer(("127.0.0.1", 0), partial(QuietHandler, directory=root))
    threading.Thread(target=server.serve_forever, daemon=True).start()

    bound = bind_services(plan, {"sf": f"http://127.0.0.1:{server.server_port}"})
    print(SequentialRunner().run(bound).value)
    server.shutdown()

Prints::

    ['sf']
    service 'sf' has no endpoint: bind with graphed.services.bind_services(plan, {'sf': 'scheme://host:port'}), or run the plan through an executor that resolves Plan.services
    150.0

``ServiceSpec("sf", "http", check="http:/sf.json")`` is the requirement: the name operations
refer to (``params={"service": "sf"}``), a ``kind`` a site can match, and how to tell the server is
ready — ``tcp``, ``http:<path>`` or ``grpc:<service>``. Naming a service the session never declared
is an error at the line that names it. The plan carries the declarations it needs as
``plan.services``, and the runner refuses a plan with a service left unbound before its first
task, naming every such service at once — so the run stops before it reads a file or writes a
part, not at the first call to a server that is not there.

``bind_services(plan, {name: endpoint})`` supplies the address, as ``scheme://host:port`` with the
scheme one of ``tcp``, ``http``, ``https``, ``grpc`` or ``grpcs`` (the ``s`` ones are TLS);
anything else is refused. Binding hands the address to the plan's workers and leaves the graph
alone: the same analysis bound to two different servers has the same graph and the same tasks.
Every plan built from a recording carries its services the same way: ``aggregate_plan`` (with its
``writes=``), the awkward ``to_parquet`` write, and ``collate``, whose plan holds the union of its
plans' services and refuses one name declared two different ways.

The shipped Triton plugin takes a service the same way: record it with
``params={"service": "tagger", ...}`` instead of a literal ``url``, and the endpoint's scheme picks
the HTTP or the gRPC client. :doc:`../preserve/design` shows that recording, and what a
preservation bundle keeps of a service — its declaration, never an address.

**Where it goes next.** Binding by hand suits a server you already have running. A
``ServiceSpec`` can also carry a ``Launch`` recipe — the command, a container image, the CPUs,
memory and GPUs it needs — and the cluster runners in ``graphed-executors`` act on the declaration
for every run: they take an endpoint you pass (``services={"sf": "http://host:port"}``), else the
one your site names, else they start the server from the recipe, check from a worker that it
answers, bind it, and stop it when the run ends. The graphed-executors
`Services <https://github.com/graphed-org/graphed-executors/blob/main/docs/htcondor.rst#services>`_
section has the details.

A ``reduce`` of your own that talks to a service is not a recorded operation, so name its service
when you build the plan — ``aggregate_plan(..., services=["name"])`` — and give the ``reduce`` two
optional methods. ``bind_services(endpoints)`` returns a bound copy, and raises ``UnboundService`` naming the service
when ``endpoints`` lacks it and the copy holds no address of its own; the pre-run check then names
it too (a ``reduce`` without the method is not checked). ``resolve_services(value)`` turns the
run's value into its final form while the services are still up — a receipt from a server into the
result it stands for — and :func:`graphed.services.resolve_services` reaches it through
``aggregate_plan`` and ``collate``. ``SequentialRunner`` starts no services, so it does not call
it; a runner that brings services up calls it before it stops them.


Joining and repartitioning datasets
-----------------------------------

Joins and repartitions are neither an awkward idiom nor a numpy one, so they are module verbs
rather than array methods. ``repartition(array, by=)`` records a hash exchange on a field,
``n=`` targets a partition count and ``target_bytes=`` coalesces by measured size. ``join`` gives
you relational, row-duplicating semantics — a probe row with *k* matches on the build side yields
*k* output rows — with ``how`` in ``{"inner", "left", "right", "outer"}``, matching
``pandas.merge`` rather than an awkward broadcast. ``pack_key`` is the same key-packing step the
join uses internally, public so you can pre-key a source.

Because a join or a repartition is a barrier, the plan for it has stages:

.. code-block:: python

    import tempfile

    import awkward as ak
    import numpy as np
    from graphed import Session, join, join_plan
    from graphed.awkward import AwkwardBackend, from_parquet

    root = tempfile.mkdtemp()
    ak.to_parquet(ak.Array({"run": np.array([1, 1, 2]), "MET_pt": np.array([10.0, 20.0, 30.0])}),
                  f"{root}/events.parquet")
    ak.to_parquet(ak.Array({"run": np.array([1, 2]), "lumi_w": np.array([0.9, 1.1])}),
                  f"{root}/lumi.parquet")

    s = Session(AwkwardBackend())
    events = from_parquet(s, "events", f"{root}/events.parquet")
    lumi = from_parquet(s, "lumi", f"{root}/lumi.parquet")

    joined = join(events, lumi, on=["run"], how="inner")
    plan = join_plan(joined)
    print([(st.kind, len(st.tasks)) for st in plan.stages])

Prints::

    [('map_write', 1), ('map_write', 1), ('gather_join', 1)]

Each side is routed and written by its own map stage; one gather stage depends on both and does
the matching. ``shuffle_plan`` is the single-source counterpart for a plain repartition: a
map-write stage and a gather stage, with the barrier edge between them. Both builders produce a
durable, byte-deterministic plan; running one across processes is ``graphed-executors``' job, and
its shuffle documentation covers where the blocks actually travel.


Reading and writing partitioned files
-------------------------------------

Two modules hold what every I/O integration shares, with no array-library content of their own:

:mod:`graphed.parquet`
    Dataset discovery that is deterministic (directories and globs sorted; an explicit list keeps
    your order, because the list is part of the dataset's identity), row counts from metadata,
    partitioning, and the convention for recording a deferred source. The array codecs live in the
    backends.

:mod:`graphed.write`
    The format-agnostic partitioned write: ``write_plan`` builds a plan whose tasks each write one
    part and report their paths up a deterministic combine tree, so the returned file list does
    not depend on which task finished first. ``file_bases``, ``blind_part_index``, ``step_of`` and
    ``part_path`` let a worker derive its own part name from its partition alone. The module also
    defines :class:`~graphed.write.PartitionedSource`: implement ``partitions()`` and
    ``read_partition(partition, columns, resources)`` and any generic consumer — the parquet
    writer, the histogram aggregator, ``aggregate_plan`` — can drive your source partition by
    partition without ever calling its whole-dataset loader.

Partitions are **blind** wherever possible: planning opens no files, and a worker resolves its own
entry range against the file it has just opened. You do not pay for a metadata scan of the whole
dataset before work starts, and a plan built on one machine stays valid on another that has never
seen the files.


Using another array library
---------------------------

Five methods are everything a backend has to provide::

    op_form(op, input_forms, params) -> Form        # record-time type/shape inference, no data
    eval_stage(op, inputs, params)   -> value       # evaluate one operation or fused member
    boundary_ops()                   -> frozenset   # which operations end a stage
    project(op, used, params)        -> used'       # narrow the read set through this operation
    external_payload(op, params)     -> descriptor  # identify a correction, model, or other call-out

A backend never sees the graph and the frontend never sees an array. ``Form`` is likewise minimal
— anything with ``describe() -> str``; the frontend stores and forwards forms, it does not
interpret them.

A backend may also provide ``canonical_output_type(spec) -> str``, which lets a caller declare an
External's element type with ``output_type=`` (on ``Array.map``, ``graphed.apply`` and
``Session.record_external``). The session calls it at the recording line, so a refusal is an error
at that line, and stores the returned string as the node's ``output_type`` param. That makes it
identity: every spelling of one type is one node, and two types are two nodes. ``op_form`` then
reads that param and returns the declared form. The frontend never interprets the string. A backend
without the method refuses every declaration. Both built-in backends map Python's ``bool``, ``int``,
``float`` and ``complex`` through ``graphed.backend.PYTHON_TYPES``, so ``int`` is ``int64`` on
every platform. The numpy backend takes numpy dtypes, including strings, flat structured records and
subarrays. awkward takes the dtypes it can represent, and also its own type strings and type
objects. An undeclared
call adds no param, so its bytes are unchanged. ``output_type=`` and ``form=`` are exclusive.
``form_params=`` passes values to ``op_form`` alone. They sit under the stored params and never
reach the node, so they cannot change its identity or bytes. The preserve layer uses it for a
plugin's ``output_dtype`` default.

A declaration is checked at run time through the backend's optional
``check_output_type(value, inputs, key, declared) -> str | None``, which returns the value's type
when it disagrees with the declaration (``key`` is ``"output_type"`` or ``"output_dtype"``). The IR
cannot carry the fact that a node declared, since a plugin param may itself be named
``output_type``, so the session wraps a declaring node's evaluator in ``CheckedExternal`` at
record time. The wrapper travels wherever the evaluator does, into plans and process pools, and
raises ``graphed.OutputTypeError`` at the recorded line. An ``output_dtype`` in ``form_params``
beside ``form=`` declares too, as ``gak.apply_correction`` does. An undeclared node keeps its bare
evaluator. An aggregate plan re-raises any other ``GraphedError`` from a worker unchanged, and turns this
one into the ``StageError`` at the declaring line.

A package that records its *own* call-outs — histogram fills are the example — passes
``descriptor=`` and ``form=`` to ``Session.record_external`` and the backend is not consulted at
all. That is how ``graphed-histogram`` exists without teaching either backend what a histogram is,
and it is the path to follow for your own deferred operation.


Wrapping graphed in a library of your own
-----------------------------------------

A library that records graphed operations on an analyst's behalf — a jet-clustering wrapper, a
file reader, a corrections layer — has four things to get right.

**Your frames are not the user's line.** Every node remembers the source line that created it, and
that line is the first frame outside ``graphed`` itself. From inside your library that frame is
*yours*, so every error and every sourcemap entry points at your source instead of the analysis.
Declare yourself internal once, at import::

    import graphed.provenance

    graphed.provenance.register_internal("mylib")

Matching is by whole dotted component: ``"mylib"`` covers ``mylib`` and ``mylib.jets``, never
``mylibx``. It is idempotent, thread-safe and process-global, and there is no inverse.

**Be aware of variations.** A verb of yours that records its own call-out takes plain arrays; when
an analyst hands it a varied collection it has to run once per universe. ``graphed.expand`` is that
mapping for a verb that answers one array — the one ``graphed.apply`` itself uses. It hands back a
single ``Varied``, so a verb that answers a tuple of arrays is outside it::

    def cluster(events, r=0.4):
        ...                                     # records one External node

    def clustered(events, r=0.4):
        return graphed.expand(cluster, (events,), {"r": r})

An unvaried call passes straight through, recording exactly what the bare call records; a varied
one comes back as a ``Varied`` over the union of labels.

**Name your opaque callables.** Two distinct callables that derive the same ``__name__`` — two
lambdas, two closures of one factory, two same-named functions of different modules — would
otherwise hash to one node and hand the second one the first one's result. They are told apart
automatically: the second object to derive ``q`` records as ``q#1``. Passing ``name=`` to ``map``,
``apply`` or ``apply_gufunc`` overrides that and declares the identity yourself, so the name must
encode *everything* that changes what the callable does — a captured cut value, a model version, a
configuration dict. Two calls under one name are one node.

**One session per program.** A node id only means something in the store that minted it, so every
``Session`` method that takes an array refuses one recorded elsewhere: the ``record_*`` family with
a located :class:`~graphed.GraphedTypeError`, the readers and ``compile_ir`` with a ``TypeError``.
Record into the session you were handed (``array.session``), never one of your own making.


Not supported yet
-----------------

* **Predicate pushdown.** Projection narrows what is read to the columns and buffers you touch,
  but a cut is applied after the read, not handed to the reader.
* **Durable collated plans.** A ``DurablePlan`` holds one graph's IR, so a collated plan, which
  runs several graphs, has no durable form; any runner still runs it.
* **Remote stores in the parquet base.** Discovery and row counts assume local filesystem paths.

:doc:`improvements` lists the limits you are most likely to hit, with the workaround for each.
