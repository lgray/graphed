If you are writing an analysis, ``graphed.awkward`` is where nearly all of your time goes:
``gak`` is the working surface. ``graphed.core`` is mostly internal — you reach into it for the
plan and partition types when you drive a runner yourself.

Record and run
--------------

The recording surface. ``Session`` owns the recording and ``Array`` is the proxy you manipulate;
``compile_ir`` and ``evaluate_ir`` turn a recording into something a worker evaluates, and
``aggregate_plan`` builds the task graph that computes several outputs in one pass over the
data, part writes included (``graphed.write.PartWrite``), and ``collate`` joins plans over different
graphs into one. ``vary`` declares a systematic variation, and ``labels`` / ``nominal`` / ``universe`` /
``variations`` read the results back (each tag's ``Kind``, a flag, beside its ordering). ``join``, ``repartition``, ``join_plan`` and
``shuffle_plan`` move rows between partitions; ``read_columns`` and ``impact_by_label`` tell you
what a recording will actually read off disk. ``output_type=`` on ``map`` and ``apply`` declares
what an opaque call returns; a value that disagrees raises ``OutputTypeError`` where it is evaluated,
and a plan run reports it as a ``StageError`` whose cause it is.
``graphed.services`` declares the servers an analysis calls (``ServiceSpec``) and binds the
addresses a run reaches them at (``bind_services``).

Ragged analysis
---------------

The backend HEP analyses live on. ``gak`` mirrors ``ak.*`` name for name and signature for
signature; ``gnano.events`` wraps a record as an event context so ``vary`` can shift a whole
collection; ``from_awkward`` and ``from_parquet`` are the sources, and ``to_parquet`` and ``parquet_write`` the writers; ``project`` and
``project_buffers`` show which columns and which pieces of them a recording needs.

Flat arrays
-----------

Deferred numpy, for rectilinear data: your ``np.*`` idiom records instead of computing.
``from_array``, the constructors (``zeros``, ``arange``, ``linspace``, …), ``apply_gufunc``, and
``default_rng`` for randomness that stays reproducible across runs.

Debugging a run
---------------

``StageError`` is what you catch: it carries the operation, the input shapes, the partition and
your source frame, and it survives the trip back from a worker process. ``format_traceback``
renders it with an arrow at your line. ``lower`` gives you the unfused, one-operation-at-a-time
view of a recording. ``Dashboard`` streams a live run; ``RunRecorder`` keeps a report of one.
``replay`` re-runs one task of a finished or failed run on your machine, step by step, and diffs it
against what the run recorded.

Resuming and preserving
-----------------------

``Store`` and ``run_resumable`` (``run_shuffle_resumable`` for a run containing an exchange)
restart a killed job without redoing finished work; ``FsspecStore`` is the same store at a URL
(``s3://``, ``file://`` or another fsspec filesystem) that several machines can share;
``RetryN`` and friends decide what to do with a partition that keeps failing, and a
dead-letter queue holds what is left.
``build_bundle``, ``inspect`` and ``reproduce`` are the export side: a directory someone else
can run, or read without running; ``attach_run_report`` keeps a run's report beside it.
``register_plugin`` adds your own payload kind.

Plans, partitions and contracts
-------------------------------

The types you touch when you drive a runner yourself or save a compiled analysis: ``Plan``,
``Task``, ``Partition``, ``SequentialRunner``, the ``Executor`` and ``Monitor`` protocols,
``RunControl`` for pausing and cancelling a run, and
``DurablePlan`` with ``with_partitions`` / ``for_dataset`` / ``for_datasets`` for re-aiming one
compiled analysis at many datasets. The rest of this module is the compiled optimizer.
