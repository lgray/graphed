How graphed.checkpoint works
============================

A batch job dies on partition 3,148 of 5,000. What do you have to redo? With a checkpoint
interval, everything since the last checkpoint, and you had to pick that interval in advance.
Here, one partition — and the answer you finally get is bit-for-bit the answer the run would
have produced if nothing had gone wrong.

This page is the argument for why that holds, and how to use it.


Why re-running is a lookup
--------------------------

Work is filed by *what it computes*, never by when or where it ran. The key for one unit of work
is a SHA-256 over three things: the recorded analysis, the processing function, and the partition.
That is the whole of :meth:`~graphed.core.DurablePlan.task_id`, and two properties fall out of it.

**Resume needs no protocol.** On a fresh run every key is missing from the store, so everything
executes and each result is written as it completes. After a crash, the same plan produces the
same keys; whatever was written is loaded instead of recomputed. There is no run manifest to
reconcile and no resume token to keep — the store *is* the state, and a run you started on
Tuesday can be finished from a different shell on Thursday.

**A stale result cannot poison a new run.** Change the analysis, change the processing function,
or change the partition, and the key changes with it. Two different computations cannot land on
one key, so at worst an old store is ignored.

The rest is bookkeeping designed not to lie to you after a crash. ``Store`` writes each result to
a temp file in the same directory, ``fsync``\ s it, and renames it into place, so a torn write is
never visible; the name of the file *is* the hash of its contents, so writing the same result
twice is a no-op. Alongside the results is an append-only journal, one ``fsync``\ ed JSON line per
completed unit. Replaying it is how a resumed run learns what is done. If the process died
halfway through appending a line, that line is unparseable and is skipped — a half-written journal
degrades to slightly less recovery, never to a corrupt one. And a journal line whose result file
is missing (the line won the race, the file lost it) is not honoured either.

Every read checks the name, too. A result whose bytes no longer hash to its file name (a disk
error, a hand edit) is treated as missing: that one partition is recomputed and the file
rewritten, rather than handing corrupted bytes to the decoder. Several threads that write the
same result at once each use their own temp file, so they cannot trip over one another, and a
writer that loses the final rename to an identical copy counts that copy as its own. None of this
is specific to ``Store``: the runners take any
:class:`~graphed.checkpoint.CheckpointStore`: ``put``, ``get``, ``record_done``, ``completed``,
``record_dead`` and ``dead_letters``, with these same promises.

Values become bytes through a ``Codec``: ``NumpyCodec`` for array results — ``numpy.save``\ 's
fixed layout, so the same array always hashes the same — and ``PickleCodec``, protocol pinned, for
everything else.


A run that actually dies
------------------------

Nothing above depends on a graceful shutdown, so here is an ungraceful one. ``killdemo.py`` is the
same per-partition histogram as before, with a hard exit wired into the fourth partition:

.. code-block:: python

    import os

    import numpy as np

    def hist_chunk(partition, resources):
        if os.environ.get("DEMO_KILL") == partition.uri and partition.entry_start == 3000:
            os._exit(137)  # a hard kill mid-run: no unwinding, no cleanup, nothing flushed
        rng = np.random.default_rng(partition.entry_start)
        n = partition.entry_stop - partition.entry_start
        return np.histogram(rng.uniform(0, 1, n), bins=4, range=(0, 1))[0]

    def hist_add(a, b):
        return a + b

    def hist_empty():
        return np.zeros(4, dtype=np.int64)

The driver runs it in a child process, waits for the corpse, then resumes in the parent. The
``if __name__ == "__main__":`` guard is required — a spawned process re-imports this module.

.. code-block:: python

    import multiprocessing as mp
    import os

    import numpy as np

    from graphed import Session
    from graphed.checkpoint import Store, run_resumable
    from graphed.core import DurablePlan, OpSpec, Partition
    from graphed.numpy import NumpyBackend, from_record

    s = Session(NumpyBackend())
    ev = from_record(s, "events", x=np.zeros(1))
    counts, _edges = np.histogram(ev["x"], bins=4, range=(0, 1))

    plan = DurablePlan(
        ir=s.serialized_ir(counts),
        process=OpSpec.from_ref("killdemo:hist_chunk"),
        combine=OpSpec.from_ref("killdemo:hist_add"),
        empty=OpSpec.from_ref("killdemo:hist_empty"),
        partitions=tuple(Partition("toy", "Events", i * 1000, (i + 1) * 1000) for i in range(6)),
    )


    def doomed_run():
        os.environ["DEMO_KILL"] = "toy"          # kill the worker on the 4th partition
        run_resumable(plan, Store("checkpoints/"))


    if __name__ == "__main__":
        p = mp.get_context("spawn").Process(target=doomed_run)
        p.start()
        p.join()
        print("the run died with exit code", p.exitcode)

        resumed = run_resumable(plan, Store("checkpoints/"))
        print("executed:", resumed.report.executed, " skipped:", resumed.report.skipped)
        print("result:", resumed.value)

::

    the run died with exit code 137
    executed: 3  skipped: 3
    result: [1499 1493 1518 1490]

Three partitions survived the kill, three were redone, and ``[1499 1493 1518 1490]`` is the same
array the uninterrupted run printed on the previous page.

The reason it is the same array and not merely a correct one: what gets stored is each partition's
own result, never a running total. The final combine walks those results in partition order, so
every partition contributes exactly once and the additions happen in the same sequence whether or
not anything crashed. That matters because floating-point addition is not associative — a running
accumulator resumed from a different point would give you a different last digit. It also means
there is no checkpoint interval to tune: a commit happens per partition, so the loss from a kill
at any moment is the one partition in flight.

``resumed.report`` is a ``ResumeReport``: ``executed``, ``skipped``, ``dead``, ``stopped``,
``dead_letters``, and ``did_less_work`` (true when anything was skipped). It is the receipt for a
resume actually having resumed.


What invalidates a cached result
--------------------------------

Everything the key is built from, and nothing else. Recording the analysis a second time gives the
same key; re-binning the histogram does not. (``myanalysis`` here is the module from
:doc:`index`.)

.. code-block:: python

    import numpy as np

    from graphed import Session
    from graphed.core import DurablePlan, OpSpec, Partition
    from graphed.numpy import NumpyBackend, from_record


    def analysis_ir(bins):
        s = Session(NumpyBackend())
        ev = from_record(s, "events", x=np.zeros(1))
        counts, _edges = np.histogram(ev["x"], bins=bins, range=(0, 1))
        return s.serialized_ir(counts)


    def make_plan(ir, process):
        return DurablePlan(
            ir=ir,
            process=process,
            combine=OpSpec.from_ref("myanalysis:hist_add"),
            empty=OpSpec.from_ref("myanalysis:hist_empty"),
            partitions=(Partition("toy", "Events", 0, 1000),),
        )


    part = Partition("toy", "Events", 0, 1000)
    chunk = OpSpec.from_ref("myanalysis:hist_chunk")
    four = analysis_ir(4)

    base = make_plan(four, chunk).task_id(part)
    print("same analysis again:  ", make_plan(analysis_ir(4), chunk).task_id(part) == base)
    print("re-binned to 8:       ", make_plan(analysis_ir(8), chunk).task_id(part) == base)
    print("different partition:  ", make_plan(four, chunk).task_id(Partition("toy", "Events", 0, 500)) == base)

    carried = OpSpec.from_callable(lambda partition, resources: 0)
    print("carried by value:     ", carried.opaque)

::

    same analysis again:   True
    re-binned to 8:        False
    different partition:   False
    carried by value:      True

The last line is the one that will bite you. ``OpSpec`` has two forms. ``OpSpec.from_ref("mypkg.jets:select")``
records an import path, so the key depends on the *name* of your function — edit its body and the
cached results survive, which is what you want when you are fixing a log message and not what you
want when you are fixing physics. ``OpSpec.from_callable`` falls back to embedding the function's
bytes when it is not importable (a lambda, a closure, something defined in ``__main__``); those
plans report ``opaque`` and their keys change every time the function changes. Prefer import paths,
and when you change what a function computes, either rename it or start a fresh store.

Variations follow the same rule: adding or removing a systematic variation changes the recorded
analysis and so invalidates the affected work, while renaming a label usually does not.


Compile once, run over many datasets
------------------------------------

Recording and optimizing an analysis costs something; running it over another sample should not
cost it again. ``DurablePlan.with_partitions`` returns a sibling plan with the same computation and
a new set of work units, sharing the recorded analysis unchanged. ``for_dataset`` and
``for_datasets`` are the convenient spellings: hand them a ``Dataset`` (a uri, an event count, and
a tree name) and a chunk size, and they do the splitting.

Because the key includes the partition, every dataset's work lands in the same store without
colliding — so a combined run over samples you have already processed individually is free:

.. code-block:: python

    import numpy as np

    from graphed import Session
    from graphed.checkpoint import Store, run_resumable
    from graphed.core import Dataset, DurablePlan, OpSpec
    from graphed.numpy import NumpyBackend, from_record

    s = Session(NumpyBackend())
    ev = from_record(s, "events", x=np.zeros(1))
    counts, _edges = np.histogram(ev["x"], bins=4, range=(0, 1))

    analysis = DurablePlan(                      # recorded and optimized once
        ir=s.serialized_ir(counts),
        process=OpSpec.from_ref("myanalysis:hist_chunk"),
        combine=OpSpec.from_ref("myanalysis:hist_add"),
        empty=OpSpec.from_ref("myanalysis:hist_empty"),
    )

    samples = [
        Dataset("ttbar.root", n_events=4000, tree="Events", name="ttbar"),
        Dataset("wjets.root", n_events=2000, tree="Events", name="wjets"),
    ]

    store = Store("checkpoints/")
    for ds in samples:
        plan = analysis.for_dataset(ds, chunk_size=1000)
        res = run_resumable(plan, store)
        print(f"{ds.name}: {len(plan.partitions)} partitions, executed {res.report.executed} -> {res.value}")

    both = analysis.for_datasets(samples, chunk_size=1000)   # one run over everything
    res = run_resumable(both, store)
    print("combined: executed", res.report.executed, "skipped", res.report.skipped, "->", res.value)

::

    ttbar: 4 partitions, executed 4 -> [1012  987 1015  986]
    wjets: 2 partitions, executed 2 -> [495 490 515 500]
    combined: executed 0 skipped 6 -> [1507 1477 1530 1486]


When a partition fails
----------------------

Failures are not interchangeable, so the recovery policies are not a single ``retries=N`` knob.
Pass one as ``retry=``:

``RetryN(n)``
    The transient hiccup — a flaky mount, a timed-out read. Runs the same partition again, up to
    *n* times. The ``resources`` object you passed to the run survives across attempts.

``RetrySmallerChunk(splits=2)``
    The partition that is simply too big. Splits its entry range and processes the pieces,
    recursing until they fit or until it can't split further, then combines the sub-results — safe
    to do because combine is associative. A chunk that ran out of memory whole succeeds split.

``RetryElsewhere(attempts=1, new_resources=...)``
    The bad worker. Retries with a fresh ``resources`` object from ``new_resources`` rather than
    burning attempts against a poisoned one.

``Quarantine()``
    Don't retry at all; go straight to the failure list.

A partition that exhausts its policy does not take the run down with it. Set ``error_budget`` and
it is recorded as a *dead letter* — the partition, the error type and message, and, when the
failure is a :class:`~graphed.debug.StageError`, the operation that failed and the line of your
analysis it came from. The run then carries on with everything else, and stops only when the dead
count exceeds the budget.

``flaky.py`` here has one file that always fails:

.. code-block:: python

    import numpy as np

    def count_chunk(partition, resources):
        if partition.uri == "corrupt.root":
            raise ValueError("unexpected EOF in basket 3")
        n = partition.entry_stop - partition.entry_start
        return np.full(4, n // 4, dtype=np.int64)

    def add(a, b):
        return a + b

    def empty():
        return np.zeros(4, dtype=np.int64)

.. code-block:: python

    import numpy as np

    from graphed import Session
    from graphed.checkpoint import RetryN, Store, run_resumable
    from graphed.core import Dataset, DurablePlan, OpSpec
    from graphed.numpy import NumpyBackend, from_record

    s = Session(NumpyBackend())
    ev = from_record(s, "events", x=np.zeros(1))
    counts, _edges = np.histogram(ev["x"], bins=4, range=(0, 1))

    plan = DurablePlan(
        ir=s.serialized_ir(counts),
        process=OpSpec.from_ref("flaky:count_chunk"),
        combine=OpSpec.from_ref("flaky:add"),
        empty=OpSpec.from_ref("flaky:empty"),
    ).for_datasets(
        [Dataset("good.root", n_events=2000), Dataset("corrupt.root", n_events=1000)],
        chunk_size=1000,
    )

    res = run_resumable(plan, Store("checkpoints/"), retry=RetryN(2), error_budget=1)

    print("executed:", res.report.executed, " dead:", res.report.dead, " stopped:", res.report.stopped)
    print("partial result:", res.value)
    for d in res.report.dead_letters:
        print(f"  {d['uri']} [{d['entry_start']}:{d['entry_stop']}] {d['error_type']}: {d['error_message']}")

::

    executed: 2  dead: 1  stopped: None
    partial result: [500 500 500 500]
      corrupt.root [0:1000] ValueError: unexpected EOF in basket 3

The failure list is a to-do list, not a pile of logs: each entry names the exact entry range to
re-run once the file is replaced. Fix the file, run the same plan against the same store, and the
two good partitions are skipped while the repaired one is processed.


Running where your analysis files aren't
----------------------------------------

A plan is bytes. ``plan.to_bytes()`` is a canonical JSON document — sorted keys, no incidental
whitespace, binary blobs base64'd — so identical plans serialize identically and a round trip
gives you the same bytes back. What it carries is the recorded analysis itself, not a pickle of
your session, plus import paths for your process/combine/empty functions. Ship those bytes to a
machine that has your packages installed and it runs there, with none of your analysis scripts on
disk:

.. code-block:: python

    import numpy as np

    from graphed import Session
    from graphed.core import DurablePlan, OpSpec, Partition
    from graphed.numpy import NumpyBackend, from_record

    s = Session(NumpyBackend())
    ev = from_record(s, "events", x=np.zeros(1))
    counts, _edges = np.histogram(ev["x"], bins=4, range=(0, 1))

    plan = DurablePlan(
        ir=s.serialized_ir(counts),
        process=OpSpec.from_ref("myanalysis:hist_chunk"),
        combine=OpSpec.from_ref("myanalysis:hist_add"),
        empty=OpSpec.from_ref("myanalysis:hist_empty"),
        partitions=(Partition("toy", "Events", 0, 1000),),
    )
    print("carries an embedded callable:", plan.opaque)
    print("computation fingerprint:", plan.ir_fingerprint()[:16])

    with open("plan.bin", "wb") as f:
        f.write(plan.to_bytes())

    # elsewhere, later, on another machine
    with open("plan.bin", "rb") as f:
        shipped = DurablePlan.from_bytes(f.read())

    print("same computation:", shipped.ir_fingerprint() == plan.ir_fingerprint())
    print("recovered graph:", shipped.graph().node_count(), "nodes")
    print("same task ids:", shipped.task_id(shipped.partitions[0]) == plan.task_id(plan.partitions[0]))

::

    carries an embedded callable: False
    computation fingerprint: 8d5fc3d15dc8a71a
    same computation: True
    recovered graph: 3 nodes
    same task ids: True

``plan.opaque`` is the one to watch. False means every callable in the plan is an import path and
the plan is fully portable. True means at least one was embedded by value, which still runs but
ties the plan to a matching interpreter and library set — :doc:`../preserve/index` surfaces that as
a reproducibility risk when you build a bundle.

Two fingerprints are available: ``ir_fingerprint()`` identifies the computation alone, so two plans
over different datasets share it; ``fingerprint()`` covers the whole plan including its partitions
and metadata.


Resuming a shuffle
------------------

A join or a repartition is not a single map-then-reduce: every task writes one block per output
partition, then every output partition collects the blocks addressed to it. ``run_shuffle_resumable``
resumes that shape, taking a ``graphed.core.DurablePlanV2`` — a plan of stages, where a gather
stage names the stages it reads. Every block is content-addressed and journaled with its stage and
the hashes of the blocks it consumed, so a crash anywhere resumes from the last durable block and
the result is byte-identical to an uninterrupted run.

The keys here also fold in the stage's routing — which key goes to which output partition, and
which exchange backend decided that. Two backends that route the same key to different destinations
therefore never file different content under the same key.

It returns a ``ShuffleResumeResult``: the content hashes of the last stage's blocks in task order,
plus the same ``ResumeReport`` you get from ``run_resumable``. ``plan.value([store.get(h) for h in
result.value])`` turns them into the run's value. A plan that calls a service must be bound first
(``graphed.services.bind_services``); an unbound one is refused before its first task.


A store at a URL
----------------

``Store`` is a directory, so a run can only be resumed where that directory is visible. Your
job died on a batch node whose scratch disk is gone; you want to finish it from your submit node
or from a different site. Put the store at a URL instead: ``FsspecStore(url, **storage_options)``
runs the same resume and dead-letter machinery against an
`fsspec <https://filesystem-spec.readthedocs.io>`_ filesystem — an ``s3://`` bucket, or a
``file://`` path on a shared mount — so any machine that can reach the URL can pick the run up.
It needs ``pip install "graphed[checkpoint]"``, and the URL's own fsspec driver (``s3fs`` for
``s3://``, ``fsspec-xrootd`` for ``root://``). The storage options go straight to fsspec:
credentials, an endpoint, and so on. The plan and its task ids do not depend on the store, so the
same plan resumes against any of them.

Here is the kill from `A run that actually dies`_ again, with the store at a ``file://`` URL. The
process that resumes is given nothing but the plan and the URL:

.. code-block:: python

    import multiprocessing as mp
    import os
    from pathlib import Path

    import numpy as np

    from graphed import Session
    from graphed.checkpoint import FsspecStore, run_resumable
    from graphed.core import DurablePlan, OpSpec, Partition
    from graphed.numpy import NumpyBackend, from_record

    s = Session(NumpyBackend())
    ev = from_record(s, "events", x=np.zeros(1))
    counts, _edges = np.histogram(ev["x"], bins=4, range=(0, 1))

    plan = DurablePlan(
        ir=s.serialized_ir(counts),
        process=OpSpec.from_ref("killdemo:hist_chunk"),
        combine=OpSpec.from_ref("killdemo:hist_add"),
        empty=OpSpec.from_ref("killdemo:hist_empty"),
        partitions=tuple(Partition("toy", "Events", i * 1000, (i + 1) * 1000) for i in range(6)),
    )

    URL = "file://" + Path("url-checkpoints").resolve().as_posix()


    def doomed_run():
        os.environ["DEMO_KILL"] = "toy"          # kill the worker on the 4th partition
        run_resumable(plan, FsspecStore(URL))


    if __name__ == "__main__":
        p = mp.get_context("spawn").Process(target=doomed_run)
        p.start()
        p.join()
        print("the run died with exit code", p.exitcode)

        resumed = run_resumable(plan, FsspecStore(URL))
        print("executed:", resumed.report.executed, " skipped:", resumed.report.skipped)
        print("result:", resumed.value)

::

    the run died with exit code 137
    executed: 3  skipped: 3
    result: [1499 1493 1518 1490]

The layout follows ``Store``'s, with one change. An object store cannot append to an object, so
each log file becomes a prefix that holds one object per record:

- ``objects/<sha256>`` holds the results, with the same names and bytes as ``Store``.
- ``journal.log/``, ``journal.<node>.log/`` and ``dead_letter.log/`` each hold one object per
  record. Each object holds the exact line ``Store`` would have appended. It is named after the
  writer (the store instance and process that wrote it: a creation time and a random id, minted
  again in a forked child) and that writer's running count, so two writers never pick the same
  name.

A result is written as one whole object, and a read checks the bytes against the name, as for
``Store``. Where a backend can leave a partly written object (a ``file://`` write is not atomic),
the torn object is never served, and the next write of that result replaces it. Writers of the
same result write the same bytes to the same name, so they need no locking. Records replay in
name order. Within one writer that is the order they were written; across writers it follows
the writers' creation times, and two created within one clock tick replay in either order. The
order only matters when one task has two records with different results, which a deterministic
task never writes.

A root belongs to one kind of store. ``Store`` and ``FsspecStore("file://...")`` cannot share a
directory, because a log is a file for one and a prefix for the other.

On S3, install ``s3fs`` and give the store an ``s3://`` URL. The credentials and the endpoint can
come from the usual AWS environment variables, or from storage options:

.. code-block:: python

    from graphed.checkpoint import FsspecStore

    # AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY and, for a non-AWS server, AWS_ENDPOINT_URL
    # are taken from the environment
    store = FsspecStore("s3://my-bucket/checkpoints/run-7")

    # or passed explicitly
    store = FsspecStore(
        "s3://my-bucket/checkpoints/run-7",
        key="...",
        secret="...",
        client_kwargs={"endpoint_url": "https://s3.example.org"},
    )

Two things differ from a local directory. Listings are always read fresh, so ``use_listings_cache``
in the storage options is overridden: a cached listing would hide records that another process
wrote after it was taken. And the constructor creates the bucket if it does not exist, so a
mistyped bucket name gives you a new, empty store, and the run recomputes everything.


Keeping each task's input for replay
------------------------------------

``aggregate_plan(..., store=root)`` turns on a second use of a store: every task of that plan
puts the chunk it read and the partial its ``reduce`` returned into ``root``, journaled as
``replay-input`` and ``replay-output`` records. The input goes in before the task evaluates, so a
failing task's input is kept too. :func:`graphed.debug.replay` reads them back to re-run one task
on the driver (see the debugging guide, "Replaying a task"). This is what "checkpointing on" means
for replay; it is independent of ``run_resumable``'s store, though the two may share a root.

``root`` is a string or a path, never a ``Store`` object, because the root is what travels inside
the plan to every worker. A root containing ``://`` opens as an ``FsspecStore`` (its credentials
and endpoint come from fsspec's own configuration, ``FSSPEC_<PROTOCOL>_<OPTION>`` variables or its
config files, read in each process); anything else opens as a ``Store`` directory, which every
worker must see at the same path, so use a shared filesystem or a URL. Give one root in one form
throughout, since the two layouts cannot share a directory.

A capture is named by the plan's graph and the task's partition, nothing else, so **a capture root
holds one run**: two plans that differ only in ``reduce`` or ``externals=``, or two runs of one
plan, written into one root overwrite each other's records. Give each run a fresh root. Captures
are pickled; a ``reduce`` whose partial does not pickle fails its task when ``store=`` is set. The
input is kept as read, with cloudpickle so a behavior holding lambdas survives: an awkward chunk
from a projected read keeps its whole type, and the buffers the read skipped reload as unread
placeholders, so a replay reads nothing the task did not.


Not supported yet
-----------------

**Recompute is sequential.** Missing partitions are processed one at a time, in order, so a big
recompute takes as long as the work does. The runners in ``graphed-executors`` run a plan in
parallel, but they do not skip work a store already holds.

**No garbage collection.** Results accumulate under the store root and nothing prunes them. Delete
the directory when a set of results is stale; there is no reachability sweep.

**Results are per-plan.** Two plans that share a sub-computation share nothing in the store, since
the key covers the whole analysis. Splitting a long analysis into stages you checkpoint separately
is the way to get reuse today.

**Retrying elsewhere means a fresh local context.** ``RetryElsewhere`` builds a new ``resources``
object; it does not move the task to another host.

See :doc:`improvements` for the shorter list of what is on the way.
