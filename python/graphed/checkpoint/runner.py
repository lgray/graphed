"""The resumable runner (plan M8): execute a ``DurablePlan`` against a checkpoint ``Store``.

Correctness model (why resume is safe):

- A task's identity is the plan's **content-addressed** ``task_id`` (SHA-256 over the IR + process
  spec + partition). Before running a partition the runner checks the Store; if its ``task_id`` is
  already journaled with a present blob, the expensive ``process`` is **skipped** and the stored
  partial is reused. So a resumed run does **measurably less work** (``skipped`` is logged).
- The final reduction recombines the **per-task partials** (in deterministic task order) — never a
  persisted running accumulator. Each partition therefore contributes **exactly once** regardless of
  where a crash happened: **no double-count, no lost partition**, and the result is bit-for-bit equal
  to an uninterrupted run.
- A failed partition is recovered by the ``retry`` policy or harvested into the Store's dead-letter
  set with a reproducible descriptor; an **error budget** is a stopping condition.

The runner itself is single-machine; the store it takes may be local (``Store``) or at a URL
(``FsspecStore``).
