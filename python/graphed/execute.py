"""IR-driven execution (M10, plan A.1-A.3): the REDUCED serialized IR is what executes.

Before this milestone the only evaluators were `Session.materialize` (a node-by-node walk of the
un-reduced Python op log) and per-partition *re-recording* of the analysis — one interpreter
dispatch per recorded op per partition, the dask failure mode the project exists to avoid
(§A.3 #2/#6/#7). This module closes that gap:

- `compile_ir(session, *outputs)` is the compile step: mark the outputs, reduce (DCE + CSE +
  equality-saturation stage fusion), serialize. The result is a small, picklable
  :class:`CompiledGraph` — pure bytes plus the source names it needs, no Session, no user code.
- `evaluate_ir(compiled, backend, sources)` runs that artifact: deserialize once, then ONE backend
  dispatch per *reduced* node (fused stage members evaluate inline), with sources bound by name.
  A worker holds no Session and never re-records; dispatch count scales with the reduced graph,
  not the recorded history.

Opaque `External` nodes are not embedded in the IR (they are a preservation risk, plan A.3.1);
`evaluate_ir` resolves them through an explicit ``externals`` mapping keyed by payload content
hash, and fails loudly when one is missing.
