"""The execution-layer contract (plan M7) — PROVISIONAL until exercised by a real adapter.

graphed-core owns the *contract*; the reference executors (a thread pool AND a process pool) live in
``graphed-exec-local``. This module is data-only — no awkward/numpy/backend imports — so the contract
stays a stable, minimal seam. A `Plan` is reduced to a single result by an `Executor`:

- work is a stream of `Task`s (fixed `tasks`, or pulled adaptively from `next_tasks`);
- each task runs `process(partition, resources)` on a worker and returns a **partial**;
- partials are combined by an **associative** `combine` via tree reduction;
- `open_once` gives file-locality (a uri opened once per worker);
- `StopCondition` ends the run early (target events / wall-clock / error budget / …);
- **error-propagation obligation**: a worker failure (process OR thread) must reach the driver
  *intact and picklable* — in particular a `graphed.debug.StageError` must NOT degrade to an opaque
  string, so the driver can render the user-source traceback (plan A.3 #8).
