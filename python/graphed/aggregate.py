"""Partition-wise aggregation plans: the multi-output, one-pass-over-a-shared-sub-graph engine.

A query producing several outputs that share a sub-graph — one selection feeding two histograms, a
sum and a count over the same cut, ... — must evaluate the shared sub-graph ONCE, not once per
output. :func:`aggregate_plan` compiles all outputs into ONE IR (so a shared sub-expression interns
to a single node), reads each partition once (projected to the UNION of the outputs' columns),
evaluates the IR once, and reduces the result. It is the dask multi-output ``compute`` analogue at
graphed's plan layer; the per-output REDUCTION is the caller's (``reduce`` folds one partition's
output-node values into a partition result; ``combine``/``empty`` reduce across partitions — each
output is whatever monoid the caller supplies: histograms add, counts sum, ...). graphed-histogram
specializes this for boost histograms; any other partition-wise reduction reuses it directly.
