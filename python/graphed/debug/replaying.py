"""Replay one task of an ``aggregate_plan`` run on the driver, one operation at a time (opt_level=0).

``replay(plan, key, *outputs)`` re-executes the task with the input it read — from the plan's
capture root (``aggregate_plan(store=)``) when the run kept it, else by re-reading its partition —
through the unfused graph, so every step carries the user's line. A failing step raises the
``StageError`` M6's ``run`` would; ``diff()`` compares the replayed partial with the recorded one.
