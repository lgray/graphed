"""The repartition/join frontend surface + the multi-stage plan builders (plan M39 §3.1-§3.3, m68c).

Two recording entry points, both backend-agnostic (graphed imports no numpy/awkward):

- :func:`repartition` — the neutral MODULE verb for a KEYED repartition (``by=`` a field). A keyed
  shuffle is neither an awkward nor a numpy idiom, so per the factorization rule it is a module
  function, not an ``Array`` method. It records a hash ``Exchange``. Count/size rebalancing is
  *physical* (moves rows, no idiom) and stays on ``Array.repartition``, which delegates here.
- :func:`join` — the neutral relational join verb, recorded as ``pack_key`` → hash ``Exchange`` per
  side → a two-input ``Join`` boundary.

The builders :func:`shuffle_plan` and :func:`join_plan` serialize such a graph as a multi-stage
:class:`~graphed.core.DurablePlanV2` whose stage processes evaluate the plan's one compiled IR on
either side of the barrier (the first ``Exchange`` of a shuffle, the ``Join`` of a join): a
``map_write`` stage per source reads each partition, evaluates up to its barrier input, and routes
every row to a dest; a ``gather``/``gather_join`` stage concatenates (or joins) each dest's blocks and
evaluates what was recorded after the barrier; an optional one-task ``reduce`` stage folds the
per-dest values. Every stage follows the ``process(task, inputs, resources) -> bytes`` convention of
``graphed.checkpoint.run_shuffle_resumable``; ``SequentialRunner`` and graphed-executors'
``SubmitRunner`` run the same plans. A map-write payload is ``pickle({dest: wire block})``
(:func:`split`/:func:`pick`), every other payload the pickled value.

A size-driven repartition (``target_bytes=``) fixes its dest count from sizes measured at run time,
which a plan's build-time task list cannot express: it runs through graphed-executors'
``run_repartition_by_size``, the block engine over the ``ShuffleBackend`` protocol.
